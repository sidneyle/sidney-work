  description = """Designed and implemented experiments based on the analysis of predictive models, leveraging  machine- and deep-learning in Python alongside large-scale clinical EHR data, including unstructured text, to drive novel health research. Consulted on statistical matters across the company, particularly on clinical trial design and hypothesis testing, which included A/B testing. Built data processing and analysis functions into Python codebase. 

Wrote and published technical papers to demonstrate novelty and significance of experimental results; developed technical aspects of grants to fund large scientific and engineering projects:
* Worked cross-functionally to construct research plans and timelines
* Managed and processed large-scale clinical EHR data for use in analysis using a Linux machine on the AWS cloud computing platform, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL
* Generated analysis reports and visualizations using Matplotlib/Seaborn
* Worked across teams, including engineering and sales, in order to communicate data needs and uses

Applied techniques include: 
* transfer and semi-supervised learning, 
* deep learning (RNN, CNN, feature extraction, GAN) (implemented in Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch) 
* NLP (Doc2Vec) 
* supervised learning (tree ensemble, generalized linear models, regression analysis, SVM)
* unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)"""
