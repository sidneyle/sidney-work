abstract: "Severe sepsis and septic shock are among the leading causes of death in the US, and early prediction can reduce adverse patient outcomes. We have previously demonstrated that a machine-learning based algorithm (MLA) can accurately predict sepsis using only patient age and vital sign data. In a recent pivotal clinical trial, elevated monocyte-distribution width (MDW) values were observed at 12 and 72 hours prior to development of clinical signs of sepsis (Sepsis-3). This study tests the hypothesis that including MDW and white blood cell count (WBC) data inputs will improve performance of an MLA for sepsis prediction."
